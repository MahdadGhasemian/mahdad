      I'm Mahdad!<br /><br />
      A backend-focused engineer with solid experience in DevOps and full-stack
      development. Over the past several years, I've designed and built
      scalable, high-performance backend systems and infrastructure, often from
      the ground up.<br /><br />
      My work spans developing APIs, managing cloud infrastructure, automating
      CI/CD pipelines, and delivering production-ready services.<br />
      I've also developed full-stack applications such as CRM panels, handling
      everything from backend architecture and database design to frontend
      integration.<br /><br />
      While my career began in electronics and embedded systems, my focus has
      since shifted entirely to software engineering, especially in the Backend
      and DevOps space. This past experience gives me a strong problem-solving
      foundation, but my current passion lies in building robust, reliable
      software systems.
